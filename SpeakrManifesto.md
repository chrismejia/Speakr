## Snap. Learn. Study.

### Snap

- A language student can take a picture of a thing.

### Learn

- Google Image Recognition will tell the student what it thinks the thing is in English (or their native language).
- The student will confirm yes/no.
- Google will send a translation of the thing back to the student.

### Study

- The language student can head to the export page, where the English thing, translated thing, and the image they took are converted to flashcard format, ready for easy importing and review.
